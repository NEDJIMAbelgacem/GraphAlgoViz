# GraphAlgoViz
Vizualization of some graphs algorithms

This is a project that I made to demonstrate some graph theory algorithms.
THe project contains :
- Interactive creation of nodes and links.
- Saving and loading graphs from text files.
- Articulation points determination.
- Travelling salesman problem exact solution using permutations.
- Travelling salesman problem exact solution using Held-Karp (n^2)*2^n complexity algorithm.
- Nearest neighbour approximate solution.
- Comparison bertween different time.
- Generation of random complete graphs.
- Graph layout fixing using Fruchterman & Reingold algorithm.

I used QuickQanava to display the graphs. Although it was painful to use, it is a great library, just not maintained.
